                        Hi, I'm Pratika! I completed my schooling in the PSBB Millennium school. Now I am doing my second year MTech Computer Science Engineering in Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology.
                        I love coding and designing. I'm a full stack developer and a freelancer. You can find me on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/Pratika17">Pratika</a>.I love to learn new things and also love to explore many stuffs.
                        I am a hardworker and my objective is to understand things better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coding is extremely rewarding. As you learn, things start to click and make sense.
                        You can join the dots of all the things that weren't quite clear before.
                        I will be consistent in my learning and I will be a great asset to any team/company.
                        I do have many coding skills which includes Java,HTML,CSS,Python,C,C++,Java Script,MYSQL,SQL,Flask,MONGODB.
